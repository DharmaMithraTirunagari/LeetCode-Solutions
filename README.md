# LeetCode Solutions in Swift Playgrounds

This repository contains my daily solutions to various coding problems, implemented in Swift Playgrounds. Each day includes a set of problems that cover different concepts, such as searching, arrays, string manipulation, and algorithms. 

---

## Day 1 - Problems
1. **Find the Smallest and Largest Number in an Array**
   - Objective: Find both the smallest and largest values in an array of integers without using higher-order functions.
   
2. **Find the Second Largest Value in an Array**
   - Objective: Identify the second largest value in an array of integers.
   
3. **Check if a String is a Palindrome**
   - Objective: Determine if a given string reads the same forwards and backwards.
   
4. **Implement Linear Search**
   - Objective: Implement a linear search algorithm to find the index of a given element in an array.

5. **Find the Max Sum of Consecutive Numbers**
   - Objective: Calculate the maximum sum of numbers located at consecutive indices in an array.

## Day 2 - Problems
1. **Digit Sum of an Integer**
   - Objective: Calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer.
   
2. **Swap Elements in an Array**
   - Objective: Swap two elements in an array at specified positions.
   
3. **Format Phone Number**
   - Objective: Reformat a string of digits into a phone number format (e.g., `(123) 456-7890`).
   
4. **Find the First Pair with a Sum Equal to Zero**
   - Objective: Identify the first pair of numbers in an array whose sum equals zero.
